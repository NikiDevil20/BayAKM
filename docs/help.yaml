SumConstraint:
  - "For adding a SumConstraint you have to choose both parameters in the constraint menu."
  - "Then select the operator '=' for both parameters and set the value to e.g. 10."
  - "This will only recommend combinations where the sum of both parameter values equals 10."
  - ""
  - "Example:"
  - "First condition: parameter -> 'water%', operator -> '=', value -> '10'"
  - "Second condition: parameter -> 'solvent%', operator -> '=', value -> '10"
  - "Result:"
  - "Only combinations where water% + solvent% = 10 will be recommended."
Expected Improvement (qEI, qLogEI):
  - "Well balanced acquisition function."
  - "Initially, it favors exploration in spaces with few data points."
  - "As more data is collected, it gradually shifts focus towards exploitation of known good areas"
What is Bayesian Optimization?:
  - "Bayesian Optimization is a strategy for the global optimization of noisy, black-box functions."
  - "It is particularly useful when the objective function is expensive to evaluate."
  - "The method builds a probabilistic model of the objective function and uses it to select the most promising points to evaluate next."
  - "This approach balances exploration (searching new areas) and exploitation (refining known good areas) to efficiently find the optimum."
  - "- wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization"
Surrogate Models:
  - "Makes predictions about the blackbox function based on previously evaluated points."
  - "This is done via a Gaussian Process, which returns a probabilty distribution over possible functions, that fit the observed data."
